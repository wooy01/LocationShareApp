Server:
The server has most of the necessary classes for the project implemented.  The server can create a socket connection with multiple clients.  Right now to demonstrate that a connection can be made the server just returns the current time to the client.

Client:
The client is just for testing that a connection can be made with the server.  The client just requests the time and the server return the time to the client.
